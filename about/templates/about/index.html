  <p class="lead">
  	1.37:1 (AKA the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_ratio">Academy Ratio</a>) is the aspect ratio that was used for films between 1928 and 1952. Since widescreen was popularized (in the early 1950s), the Academy Ratio has basically been nonexistent, except in very specific, deliberate cases (in films like <em>The Artist</em>, <em>Elephant</em>, and <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>).
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
  	Why did I decide to name this 1.37:1 - an annoying-to-say, meaningless-to-most aspect ratio? I wanted a name that highlighted the very small overlap in the very large Venn diagram of film and data/numbers, and this is the best I could do. (And hey, if everyone knows what 538 means now, I figured I could make do with some seemingly random numbers.)
